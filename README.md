KVH IMU Implementation in C

This repository is a placeholder for the public header files for `libimu`.
These header files are used in the public version of `hyperloop-core`.

Out of an abundance of caution, the source for `libimu` is kept secured in 
a private location due to U.S. Export Control concerns (A KVH IMU is a 
pretty serious instrument).  Should you require a copy of the `libimu` 
source or a compiled binary version of the library, then you should 
contact OpenLoop Software Engineering and we will review your request and 
export concerns further.
